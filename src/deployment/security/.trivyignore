# Trivy Ignore File for Voice Agents Platform
# Add CVEs that are acceptable risks or false positives

# Development and testing dependencies (low risk in production)
# Uncomment and add specific CVEs as needed

# Example ignores (remove as appropriate):
# CVE-2019-12345  # Example: low severity issue in test dependency
# CVE-2020-67890  # Example: false positive in specific context

# Build tools and development dependencies
# These are typically not present in production containers

# Documentation and example code vulnerabilities
# Often not exploitable in production context

# Legacy dependencies with no viable alternatives
# Document business justification for each

# Note: Each ignore should have:
# 1. CVE ID
# 2. Reason for ignoring  
# 3. Review date
# 4. Approval from security team

# Example format:
# CVE-2023-12345  # Low risk - dev dependency only, reviewed 2024-01-15, approved by security team
