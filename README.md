# Building Voice Agents

This repository contains course materials from the **DeepLearning.AI** course "Building Voice Agents" - a comprehensive guide to creating real-time voice conversation agents using modern AI technologies.

## Overview

Learn how to build voice agents that can have natural, real-time conversations using:
- **LiveKit Agents Framework** for real-time communication
- **OpenAI** models (GPT-4o, Whisper) for language understanding and speech-to-text
- **ElevenLabs** for natural text-to-speech synthesis
- **Silero VAD** for voice activity detection

## Course Structure

### Lesson 4: Voice Agent Components
Introduction to the core components of a voice agent:
- Speech-to-Text (STT) using OpenAI Whisper
- Large Language Model (LLM) using GPT-4o
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) using ElevenLabs
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) using Silero

### Lesson 5: Optimizing Latency
Advanced topics on performance optimization:
- Measuring and monitoring latency metrics
- Understanding TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTFB (Time to First Byte)
- Optimizing end-to-end conversation latency
- Performance debugging techniques

### Appendix
Additional resources and tips for using the course platform and troubleshooting common issues.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.11
- Basic knowledge of Python and asynchronous programming
- API keys for OpenAI and ElevenLabs services
